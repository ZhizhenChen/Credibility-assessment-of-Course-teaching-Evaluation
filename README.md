# Credibility-assessment-of-Course-teaching-Evaluation

Hi! This project is about processing Course Teaching Evaluation(CTE) data, which includes features regarding course id, course CTE scores, professors' id, professors' CTE scores, student's id, students' taken courses and corresponding semester, students' grade in a specific course, students' records of entering and existing colleges as well as students' book borrowing records. All the data have been recoded to ensure data privacy.
My task is to preprocess these data and generate the casual relationship between these features.
